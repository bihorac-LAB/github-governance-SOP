This directory is designed to store training materials related to GitHub SOPs and organizational governance policies.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a centralized location for:
- Training presentation slides
- Video recordings of training sessions
- Workshop materials and handouts
- Instructor guides and lesson plans
- Assessment materials and answer keys

## Planned Content Structure

```

├── presentations/          # PowerPoint, PDF slides
├── videos/                # Training session recordings
├── workshops/             # Hands-on exercise materials
├── assessments/           # Quizzes, tests, evaluations
├── instructor-guides/     # Materials for trainers
└── handouts/             # Printable reference materials
```

## File Naming Conventions

When adding materials, please use consistent naming:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_topic_type_version.ext
```

Examples:
- `2024-11-18_github-basics_slides_v1.pptx`
- `2024-11-18_governance-overview_video_final.mp4`
- `2024-11-18_data-safety_workshop_v2.pdf`

## Integration with Website

Training materials should complement the [website documentation](../docs/):
- Website provides self-paced learning resources
- Training materials support instructor-led sessions
- Both should reference the formal [SOPs](../sops/) as authoritative source

## Maintenance

- Archive old versions but keep for reference
- Update materials when policies change
- Gather feedback and continuously improve content
- Ensure materials stay current with GitHub feature updates

## Usage Guidelines

### For Trainers
- Review latest SOPs before conducting training
- Use website as reference during sessions
- Collect feedback and suggestions for improvement

### For Trainees
- Complete pre-work assignments from website
- Participate actively in hands-on exercises
- Reference materials are available for future use

## Future Development

This directory will grow to include:
- Advanced GitHub features training
- Integration with institutional learning systems
- Certification or competency tracking materials
- Regular refresher training content

**Current Status**: Directory structure established, ready for training material development.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Develop initial presentation materials
2. Create hands-on workshop exercises
3. Record training sessions for asynchronous learning
4. Implement feedback collection mechanisms
