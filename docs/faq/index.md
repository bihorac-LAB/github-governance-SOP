# FAQ for Non-Technical Staff

**Q1: Do I need to install Git on my computer to use GitHub?**  
**A:** No. You can view repositories, read documents, and comment using just a web browser.

**Q2: Can I upload PowerPoint slides or PDFs?**  
**A:** Yes, as long as they contain **no PHI/PII** and no confidential internal information that is not meant to be shared.

**Q3: Can I upload screenshots of the EHR to show examples?**  
**A:** Absolutely not. Screenshots almost always contain PHI or sensitive information and are forbidden on GitHub.

**Q4: What if I’m not sure whether something is allowed?**  
**A:** If in doubt, treat it as **not allowed** and ask a maintainer or compliance contact.

**Q5: Do I have to understand pull requests and branches?**  
**A:** If you are only a **viewer**, no. If you are a **contributor**, you should learn the basics (Section 2.3 links help with that).
