# GitHub Governance & Training Portal

Welcome to the internal **GitHub Governance & Training** documentation site.

This site is built with **MkDocs + Material theme** and is intended for:

- Technical staff (engineers, data scientists, developers)
- Research staff (analysts, postdocs, students)
- Clinical staff (physicians, nurses, clinical researchers)
- Compliance, data governance, and leadership

Use this site as the **single source of truth** for:

- GitHub usage and governance (SOP)
- Training and onboarding
- Data safety and classification
- Repository creation and lifecycle
- Automation via GitHub Actions (“robots”)
- Routine reviews, audits, and incident response
