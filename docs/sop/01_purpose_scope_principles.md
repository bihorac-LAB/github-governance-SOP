# 1. Purpose, Scope, and Principles

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines **how our organization uses GitHub** to support:

- Educational activities  
- Research and development  
- Publication and open science  
- Reproducible data science and AI  
- Internal tools and automation  

It is designed for a **mixed audience** of:

- Technical staff (engineers, data scientists, developers)  
- Research staff (PhD students, analysts, postdocs)  
- Clinical staff (physicians, nurses, clinical researchers)  

### 1.2 Scope

This SOP covers:

- Access to the organization’s GitHub  
- Roles and permissions  
- Repo creation and lifecycle  
- Safe use of GitHub with respect to clinical data and privacy  
- Use of GitHub for published journals and educational materials  
- Automation via GitHub Actions (“robots”)  
- Routine review, audits, and incident response  

### 1.3 Principles

We follow these core principles:

1. **Safety first**: No PHI/PII or sensitive clinical data in GitHub.  
2. **Least privilege**: Users get only the access they need.  
3. **Auditability**: Use branches, pull requests, and reviews so we can trace changes.  
4. **Reproducibility**: Encourage clean, documented code and clear versions for research.  
5. **Education-friendly**: Provide clear explanations and links for non-technical staff.  
6. **Automation-assisted**: Use robots to enforce rules consistently and reduce human error.
