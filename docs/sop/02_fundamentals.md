# 2. GitHub Fundamentals (For All Staff)

This section helps **non-technical staff** understand GitHub and provides links for self-learning.

### 2.1 What GitHub Is

- A **platform for collaboration** on code and documents.  
- Built around **Git**, a version control system that tracks changes over time.  
- Supports **issues, pull requests, reviews, and automation**.  
- Useful for **education, research, and software development**.  

> GitHub is *not* an EHR system, not a database for real patient data, and not a general file dump.
