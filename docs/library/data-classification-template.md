## Risk Assessment

### Data Exposure Risk Level

Based on the above answers, classify this repository:

- [ ] **MINIMAL RISK** - Public data, no privacy concerns
- [ ] **LOW RISK** - Internal data, low sensitivity
- [ ] **MODERATE RISK** - Restricted data, moderate controls needed
- [ ] **HIGH RISK** - Sensitive data, strict controls required
- [ ] **UNACCEPTABLE RISK** - Cannot be hosted on GitHub

### Mitigation Requirements

For repositories with moderate or high risk, complete this section:

#### Required Security Controls
- [ ] Private repository (not public)
- [ ] Restricted team access only
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled
- [ ] Required pull request reviews
- [ ] Required status checks
- [ ] Secrets scanning enabled
- [ ] Vulnerability alerts enabled

#### Additional Safeguards
- [ ] Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] External sharing restrictions
- [ ] Automated compliance scanning
- [ ] Regular backup procedures

## Documentation Requirements

### README.md Content
The repository README must include:

- [ ] Clear description of data classification level
- [ ] Data usage restrictions and guidelines
- [ ] Contact information for data steward
- [ ] Links to relevant policies and procedures
- [ ] Instructions for requesting access

### Additional Documentation
- [ ] Data dictionary (if applicable)
- [ ] Data lineage documentation
- [ ] Compliance certification records
- [ ] Access approval records

## Approval Process

### Self-Assessment Results

**Recommended Classification**: `________________`

**Reasoning**: 
```
[Explain why this classification is appropriate based on the assessment]
```

### Required Approvals

For repositories classified as:
- **Minimal/Low Risk**: Repository owner approval sufficient
- **Moderate Risk**: Department/team lead approval required
- **High Risk**: Governance team approval required
- **Unacceptable Risk**: Repository cannot be created

### Approval Signatures

- **Repository Owner**: `________________` Date: `________________`
- **Team Lead**: `________________` Date: `________________` *(if required)*
- **Governance Team**: `________________` Date: `________________` *(if required)*

## Periodic Review

This classification must be reviewed:
- [ ] Annually (minimum)
- [ ] When repository content changes significantly
- [ ] When access requirements change
- [ ] When compliance requirements change
- [ ] When security incidents occur

**Next Review Date**: `________________`
