# Onboarding – Start Here

Welcome! This page is the **starting point** for anyone who wants to use our GitHub organization.

This onboarding is public on purpose so that:

- New collaborators, students, and clinicians can learn the rules *before* getting access.
- Everyone can see our governance and expectations clearly.
- We keep our internal code and data private, but our **policies** open and transparent.

## 3. Requesting Access

After you have:

- Read the essential SOP sections, and  
- Completed the onboarding quiz,

you should request access using **one** of the following patterns (depending on your team’s preference):

### Option A – Request via Issue (GitHub-native)

1. Go to the **governance repo** on GitHub (this site’s repository).
2. Open a new Issue using the **“Access Request”** template (your admin can set this up).
3. Include:
   - Your name and institutional email.
   - Your role (clinical / research / technical / other).
   - Confirmation that you:
     - Read the SOP sections listed above.
     - Completed the onboarding quiz and understand the rules.
4. Your manager/PI and/or maintainers will review and approve.

### Option B – Request via Internal Form

Your team may choose to use an internal form (e.g., Microsoft, Google, or institutional system).  
If so, the link will be provided by your local administrator.

## 4. What You Will *Not* Get Access To

Even after onboarding, you **will not** receive access to:

- Any repository that contains or risks containing PHI/PII.
- Any secrets, keys, passwords, or internal production systems.
- Any system that is outside the scope of your role.

Access follows the **principle of least privilege** and is always tied to role and need.
