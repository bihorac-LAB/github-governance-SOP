# 10. Security and Compliance Requirements

All users must follow these security rules:

- **Two-Factor Authentication is mandatory** for all organization members.  
- Do not commit **secrets** (passwords, tokens) to any repository.  
- Do not commit **clinical data** or anything resembling PHI/PII.  
- Use **branch protection rules** on main branches (`main`, `master`).  
- Any exception to policies must be explicitly approved by compliance/leadership and documented.
