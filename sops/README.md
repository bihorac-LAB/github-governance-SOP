# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

This directory contains formal Standard Operating Procedure documents for GitHub governance and other organizational policies.

## Purpose

These files serve as **formal reference documentation** and are maintained separately from the user-friendly website content in the `/docs` directory.

## Current SOPs

## Relationship to Website

The formal SOPs in this directory serve as the **authoritative reference**, while the website (`/docs`) provides:
- User-friendly guides and tutorials
- Interactive content like quizzes
- Step-by-step how-to instructions
- FAQ and troubleshooting

## When to Use SOPs vs Website

**Use SOPs when:**
- Writing formal policies or procedures
- Need authoritative reference documentation
- Compliance or audit requirements
- Creating training materials for administrators

**Use Website when:**
- Daily operational tasks
- Onboarding new users
- Troubleshooting issues
- Quick reference guides

## Maintenance

- SOPs should be updated when policies change
- Changes to SOPs may require corresponding updates to website content
- Version control through Git provides audit trail for policy changes
- Regular review ensures SOPs remain current and accurate

## Future Expansion

This directory is designed to accommodate:
- Additional GitHub-related SOPs
- Other organizational Standard Operating Procedures
- Department-specific governance documents
- Integration with broader institutional policies

**Note**: For day-to-day GitHub usage, most users should refer to the [website documentation](https://your-org.github.io/github-governance-SOP/) rather than these formal SOPs.
